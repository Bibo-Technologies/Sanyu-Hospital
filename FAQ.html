    <div class="term" data-term-id="Pregnancy" data-term-details="Pregnancy is the period from the formation of an embryo in a female womb till childbirth. It is also called gestation period, and it usually lasts for 40 weeks from the last menstrual period. The symptoms of pregnancy include missed periods, nausea, vomiting, implantation bleeding, and breast tenderness.">Pregnancy</div>
    <div class="term" data-term-id="Delayed Periods" data-term-details="If you’re not pregnant, your period may be late due to a great deal of stress or low body weight.
     Certain conditions, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), diabetes, and others, can also affect your menstrual cycle.

    Worried about a late period but know you’re not pregnant? Missed or late periods happen for many reasons other than pregnancy. Common causes can range from hormonal imbalances to serious medical conditions.
    
    Research shows that the prevalence of irregular menstrual cycles is 5-35.6% depending on your age, your occupation, and where you live.
    
    There are also two times when it’s typical for your period to be irregular: when it first begins and when the menopause transition starts. As your body goes through the transition, your cycle can become irregular.
    
    In this article, we discuss eight reasons your period may be late besides pregnancy.
    
    How long is it normal for a period to be late?
    
    1. Stress
Chronic stress can throw off your hormones, change your daily routine, and even affectTrusted Source the part of your brain responsible for regulating your period: your hypothalamus. Over time, stress can lead to illness or sudden weight gain or loss, all of which can impact your cycle.

If you think stress might be throwing off your period, try practicing relaxation techniques and making lifestyle changes.

Chronic stress can also affect other health conditions you’re living with, so addressing it yourself or with the help of a medical professional is an important part of taking care of your overall well-being.

2. Low body weight
People who have eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia, may experience irregularities in their cycle. Losing too much weight can causeTrusted Source irregular periods and may even stop your cycle altogether. This is because not having enough body fat can pause ovulation.

Getting treatment for your eating disorder and getting to the point where your body fat is optimal again can return your cycle back to its original length.

People who participate in extreme exercises, such as marathons, may also experience cycle irregularities as well.

3. Obesity
In the same way that living with a low body weight can cause hormonal changes, living with a high body weight can also cause irregularities.

Obesity can causeTrusted Source the body to produce an overabundance of estrogen, which is a key reproductive hormone. Too much estrogen can cause irregularities in your cycle and may even stop your periods altogether.

If your doctor has determined that obesity is a factor in your late or missed periods, they may advise you to lose weight through lifestyle changes, such as focusing on nutrient-dense foods and exercising.

4. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
PCOS is a condition that causes your body to produce more of the male hormone androgen. Cysts form on the ovaries as a result of this hormone imbalance. This can make ovulation irregular or stop it altogether.

Other hormones, such as insulin, may also become unbalanced. This is due to insulin resistance, which is often associated with PCOS.

Treatment for PCOS focuses on relieving symptoms. Your doctor may prescribe birth control or another medication to help regulate your cycle.

5. Birth control
You may experience a change in your cycle when you go on or off birth control. Birth control pills contain the hormones estrogen and progestin, which prevent your ovaries from releasing eggs.

It can take up to 3 months for your cycle to become consistent again after you stop taking the pill.

Other types of contraceptives that are implanted or injected can cause missed periods as well.

6. Chronic diseases
Chronic diseases, such as diabetes and celiac disease, can also affect your menstrual cycle. Changes in blood sugar are linked to hormonal changes, so even though it’s rare, unmanaged diabetes could causeTrusted Source your period to be irregular.

Celiac disease causes inflammation that can lead to damage in your small intestine, which may prevent your body from absorbing key nutrients. This can causeTrusted Source irregular or missed periods.

Other chronic conditions that may lead to cycle irregularities include:

Cushing syndrome
congenital adrenal hyperplasia
Asherman’s syndrome
7. Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)
Most vagina owners begin menopause between the ages of 45-55. Those who develop symptoms around age 40 or earlier may be experiencing primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) or early natural menopause.

About 1%Trusted Source of women before the age of 40 experience POI. While this condition can arise from the surgical removal of the ovaries, other causes include genetic disorders and autoimmune conditions.

If you’re experiencing missed periods and you’re 40 years old or younger, contact your doctor to talk about POI testing and treatment.

8. Thyroid issues
An overactive or underactive thyroid gland could also be the cause of late or missed periods.

The thyroid regulates your body’s metabolism, so hormone levels can be affected as well. Thyroid issues can usually be treated with medication. After treatment, your period will likely return to your normal cycle.

    <div class="term" data-term-id="Headache" data-term-details="Headaches are a very common condition that most people will experience many times during their lives. The main symptom of a headache is pain in your head or face. There are several types of headaches, and tension headaches are the most common. While most headaches aren’t dangerous, certain types can be a sign of a serious underlying condition.
    What is a headache?
A headache is a pain in your head or face that’s often described as a pressure that’s throbbing, constant, sharp or dull. Headaches can differ greatly in regard to pain type, severity, location and frequency.

Headaches are a very common condition that most people will experience many times during their lives. They’re the most common form of pain and are a major reason cited for days missed at work or school, as well as visits to healthcare providers.

While most headaches aren’t dangerous, certain types can be a sign of a more serious condition.

What are the types of headaches?
There are more than 150 types of headaches. They fall into two main categories: primary and secondary headaches.

Primary headaches
Dysfunction or over-activity of pain-sensitive features in your head cause primary headaches. They’re not a symptom of or caused by an underlying medical condition. Some people may have genes that make them more likely to develop primary headaches.

Types of primary headaches include:

Tension-type headaches (most common type of headache).
Migraine headaches.
Cluster headaches.
New daily persistent headaches (NDPH).
Some primary headaches can be triggered by lifestyle factors or situations, including:

Alcohol, particularly red wine.
Certain foods, such as processed meats that contain nitrates (food-triggered headaches).
Consuming nicotine (nicotine headache).
Changes in sleep or lack of sleep.
Poor posture.
Physical activity, such as exercise (exertion headaches).
Skipped meals (hunger headache).
Coughing, sneezing, blowing your nose, straining (such as when having a bowel movement), or laughing or crying vigorously (primary cough headaches).
Primary headaches typically aren’t dangerous, but they can be very painful and disrupt your day-to-day life.

Secondary headaches
An underlying medical condition causes secondary headaches. They’re considered a symptom or sign of a condition.

Types of secondary headaches that aren’t necessarily dangerous and resolve once the underlying condition is treated include:

Dehydration headache.
Sinus headaches.
Medication overuse headaches.
Types of secondary headaches that can be a sign of a serious or potentially life-threatening condition include:

Spinal headaches: Spinal headaches are intense headaches that occur when spinal fluid leaks out of the membrane covering your spinal cord, usually after a spinal tap. Most spinal headaches can be treated at home, but prolonged, untreated spinal headaches can cause life-threatening complications, including subdural hematoma and seizures.

Thunderclap headaches: A thunderclap headache is an extremely painful headache that comes on suddenly, like a clap of thunder. This type of headache reaches its most intense pain within one minute and lasts at least five minutes. While thunderclap headaches can sometimes be harmless, it’s important to seek immediate medical attention. They can be a sign of:

Head injury.
Brain bleed.
Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome.
A sudden, severe rise in blood pressure.
What’s the difference between a headache and a migraine?
A migraine is a type of primary headache disorder.

A migraine is a common neurological condition that causes a variety of symptoms, most notably a throbbing headache on one side of your head. Migraines often get worse with physical activity, lights, sounds or smells. They usually last at least four hours or even days.

Who do headaches affect?
Anyone can have a headache, including children, adolescents and adults. About 96% of people experience a headache at least once in their life.

About 40% of people across the world have tension-type headaches and about 10% have migraine headaches.

Symptoms and Causes
What is the main cause of a headache?
Headache pain results from signals interacting among your brain, blood vessels and surrounding nerves. During a headache, multiple mechanisms activate specific nerves that affect muscles and blood vessels. These nerves send pain signals to your brain, causing a headache.

Are headaches hereditary?
Headaches tend to run in families, especially migraines. Children who have migraines usually have at least one biological parent who also experiences them. In fact, kids whose parents have migraines are up to four times more likely to develop them.

Headaches can also be triggered by environmental factors shared in a family’s household, such as:

Eating certain foods or ingredients, like caffeine, alcohol, fermented foods, chocolate and cheese.
Exposure to allergens.
Secondhand smoke.
Strong odors from household chemicals or perfumes.
What headache symptoms require immediate medical care?
If you or your child has any of these headache symptoms, get medical care right away:

A sudden, new and severe headache.
Headache with a fever, shortness of breath, stiff neck or rash.
Headaches that occur after a head injury or accident.
Getting a new type of headache after age 55.
Also seek medical care right away if your headache is associated with neurological symptoms, such as:

Weakness.
Dizziness.
Sudden loss of balance or falling.
Numbness or tingling.
Paralysis.
Speech difficulties.
Mental confusion.
Seizures.
Personality changes/inappropriate behavior.
Vision changes (blurry vision, double vision or blind spots).
Diagnosis and Tests
How are headaches evaluated and diagnosed?
If you have headaches often or if they’re very severe, reach out to your healthcare provider.

It’s important to diagnose headaches correctly so your provider can prescribe specific therapy to help you feel better. Your provider will complete a physical examination, discuss your medical history and talk to you about your headache symptoms. This conversation is part of a headache evaluation.

During the headache evaluation, your provider will ask you about your headache history, including:

What the headaches feel like.
How often the headaches happen.
How long the headaches last each time.
How much pain the headaches cause you.
What foods, drinks or events trigger your headaches.
How much caffeine you drink each day.
What your stress level is.
What your sleep habits are like.
Your headache can be more accurately diagnosed by knowing:

When the headache started.
Whether there’s a single type of headache or multiple types of headaches.
If physical activity aggravates the headache pain.
Who else in your family has headaches.
What symptoms, if any, occur between headaches.
After completing the medical history part of the evaluation, your provider may perform physical and neurological examinations. They’ll look for signs and symptoms of an illness or condition that may be causing the headache, including:

Fever.
Infection.
High blood pressure.
Muscle weakness, numbness or tingling.
Excessive fatigue.
Loss of consciousness.
Balance problems and frequent falls.
Vision problems (blurry vision, double vision, blind spots).
Mental confusion or personality changes.
Seizures.
Dizziness.
Nausea and vomiting.
Neurological tests focus on ruling out diseases that might also cause headaches. A disorder of your central nervous system might be suspected in the development of serious headaches.

After evaluating the results of your headache history, physical examination and neurological examination, your physician should be able to determine what type of headache you have, whether or not a serious problem is present and whether additional tests are needed.

If they’re unsure of the cause, they may refer you to a headache specialist.

What tests will be done to diagnose headaches?
Although scans and other imagining tests can be important when ruling out other diseases, they don’t help in diagnosing migraines, cluster or tension-type headaches.

But if your healthcare provider thinks that your headaches are being caused by another medical condition, there are several imaging tests they may order.

A CT scan or MRI can help determine if your headaches are connected to an issue with your central nervous system. Both of these tests produce cross-sectional images of your brain that can show any abnormal areas or problems.

Management and Treatment
How is a headache treated?
Treatment for headaches depends on the type.

One of the most crucial aspects of treating primary headaches is figuring out your triggers. Learning what those are — typically by keeping a headache log — can reduce the number of headaches you have.

Once you know your triggers, your healthcare provider can tailor treatment to you. For example, you may get headaches when you’re tense or worried. Counseling and stress management techniques can help you handle this trigger better. By lowering your stress level, you can avoid stress-induced headaches.

Not every headache requires medication. A range of treatments is available. Depending on your headache type, frequency and cause, treatment options include:

Stress management.
Biofeedback.
Medications.
Treating the underlying medical condition/cause.
Stress management for headache
Stress management teaches you ways to cope with stressful situations. Relaxation techniques help manage stress. You use deep breathing, muscle relaxation, mental images and music to ease your tension.

Biofeedback for headache
Biofeedback teaches you to recognize when tension is building in your body. You learn how your body responds to stressful situations and ways to settle it down. During biofeedback, sensors are connected to your body. They monitor your involuntary physical responses to headaches, which include increases in:

Breathing rate.
Pulse.
Heart rate.
Temperature.
Muscle tension.
Brain activity.
Medications for headache
Occasional tension headaches usually respond well to over-the-counter pain relievers. But be aware that using these medications too often can lead to long-term daily headaches (medication overuse headaches).

For frequent or severe headaches, your provider may recommend prescription headache medications. Triptans and other types of drugs can stop a migraine attack. You take them at the first signs of an oncoming headache.

Drugs for high blood pressure, seizures and depression can sometimes prevent migraines. Your healthcare provider may recommend trying one of these medications to reduce headache frequency.

Treating the underlying medical condition causing secondary headache
Treatment for secondary headaches involves treating the underlying medical condition causing it.

For example, surgery is often needed to correct the underlying cause of secondary cough headache.

How can I get rid of a headache?
You can treat the occasional, mild headache at home with over-the-counter pain relievers. Other self-care treatments for headaches include:

Applying heat or cold packs to your head.
Doing stretching exercises.
Massaging your head, neck or back.
Resting in a dark and quiet room.
Taking a walk.
Prevention
How can I prevent headaches?
The key to preventing headaches is figuring out what triggers them. Triggers are very specific to each person — what gives you a headache may not be a problem for others. Once you determine your triggers, you can avoid or minimize them.

For example, you may find that strong scents set you off. Avoiding perfumes and scented products can make a big difference in how many headaches you have. The same goes for other common triggers like troublesome foods, lack of sleep and poor posture.

Many people, however, aren’t able to avoid triggers or are unable to identify triggers. In that case, a more personalized multidisciplinary approach with a headache specialist is often necessary.

Outlook / Prognosis
Can headaches or migraines be cured?
Treating health problems that cause headaches, such as high blood pressure, can eliminate head pain. Recently, there have been several new advancements in our understanding of what causes headaches.

Although researchers are closer than ever before to a cure, at this time, there isn’t a cure for primary headaches. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and preventing future episodes.

    <div class="term" data-term-id="Chest Pain" data-term-details="Chest pain appears in many forms, ranging from a sharp stab to a dull ache. Sometimes chest pain feels crushing or burning. In certain cases, the pain travels up the neck and into the jaw and then spreads to the back or down one or both arms.

    Many different problems can cause chest pain. The most life-threatening causes involve the heart or lungs. Because chest pain can be due to a serious problem, it's important to seek immediate medical help.
    Symptoms
Chest pain can feel different depending on what's triggering the symptom. Often, the cause has nothing to do with the heart — though there's no easy way to tell without seeing a health care provider.

Heart-related chest pain
Chest pain is often associated with heart disease. But many people with heart disease say they have a mild discomfort that they wouldn't really call pain. Chest discomfort due to a heart attack or another heart problem may feel like:

Pressure, fullness, burning or tightness in the chest.
Crushing or searing pain that spreads to the back, neck, jaw, shoulders, and one or both arms.
Pain that lasts more than a few minutes, gets worse with activity, goes away and comes back, or varies in intensity.
Shortness of breath.
Cold sweats.
Dizziness, lightheadedness or weakness.
Racing heartbeats.
Nausea or vomiting.
Other types of chest pain
It can be difficult to tell if chest pain is related to the heart or caused by something else. Usually, chest pain is less likely due to a heart problem if it happens with:

A sour taste or a sensation of food reentering the mouth
Trouble swallowing
Pain that gets better or worse when you change body position
Pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough
Tenderness when you push on your chest
Pain that continues for many hours
The classic symptoms of heartburn — a painful, burning sensation behind the breastbone — can be caused by problems with the heart or the stomach.


Causes
Chest pain has many possible causes, all of which need medical care.

Heart-related causes
Examples of heart-related causes of chest pain include:

Angina. This is chest pain caused by poor blood flow to the heart. This is often caused by the buildup of thick plaques on the inner walls of the arteries that carry blood to the heart. These plaques narrow the arteries and restrict the heart's blood supply, particularly during physical activity.
Heart attack. A heart attack results from blocked blood flow to the heart muscle, often from a blood clot. Angina can be the main symptom felt during a heart attack.
Aortic dissection. This life-threatening condition involves the main artery leading from the heart, called the aorta. If the inner layers of this blood vessel separate, blood is forced between the layers and can cause the aorta to rupture.
Inflammation of the sac around the heart, called pericarditis. This condition usually causes sharp pain that gets worse when breathing in or lying down.
Digestive causes
Chest pain can be caused by disorders of the digestive system, including:

Heartburn. This is a painful, burning feeling behind the breastbone. It occurs when stomach acid washes up from the stomach into the tube that connects the throat to the stomach. That tube is called the esophagus.
Swallowing disorders. Problems with the esophagus can make swallowing difficult and even painful.
Gallbladder or pancreas problems. Gallstones or inflammation of the gallbladder or pancreas can cause stomach pain that spreads to the chest.
Muscle and bone causes
Some types of chest pain are associated with injuries and other problems affecting the structures that make up the chest wall. These conditions include:

Costochondritis. In this condition, the cartilage of the rib cage, particularly the cartilage that joins the ribs to the breastbone, becomes inflamed and painful.
Sore muscles. Chronic pain syndromes, such as fibromyalgia, may cause long-term pain that affects the chest muscles.
Injured ribs. A bruised or broken rib can cause chest pain.
Lung-related causes
Many lung problems can cause chest pain, including:

A blood clot in the lung, called a pulmonary embolism. A blood clot that gets stuck in a lung artery can block blood flow to lung tissue.
Inflammation of the membrane covering the lungs, called pleurisy. This condition causes chest pain that gets worse when you breathe in or cough.
Collapsed lung. Chest pain due a collapsed lung typically begins suddenly. It can last for hours. It usually causes shortness of breath. A collapsed lung occurs when air leaks into the space between the lung and the ribs.
High blood pressure in the lung arteries, called pulmonary hypertension. This condition affects the arteries carrying blood to the lungs. It can cause chest pain.
Other causes
Chest pain also can be caused by:

Panic attack. If you have periods of intense fear with chest pain, you may be having a panic attack. Panic attack symptoms also include a rapid heartbeat, rapid breathing, a lot of sweating, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness and a fear of dying. It can be hard to tell the difference between a heart attack and a panic attack. Always seek medical help if you aren't sure of the cause of chest pain.
Shingles. This condition can cause intense pain and a band of blisters from the back around to the chest area.

    <div class="term" data-term-id="Erectile dysfunction" data-term-details="Erectile dysfunction (impotence)
    Erectile dysfunction (impotence) is very common, particularly in men over 40. It's usually nothing to worry about, but see a GP if it keeps happening.
    
    What is erectile dysfunction?
    Erectile dysfunction is when you are either:
    
    unable to get an erection
    unable to keep an erection for long enough to have sex
    Depending on the cause, you may still be able to get an erection at other times, such as when you wake up.
    
    Sometimes you might also have low sex drive (loss of libido).
    
    Causes of erectile dysfunction
    Most men occasionally fail to get or keep an erection.
    
    This is usually caused by stress, tiredness or drinking too much alcohol, and it's nothing to worry about.
    
    It can also be a side effect of some medicines.
    
    If erectile dysfunction happens often, it may be caused by a condition such as:
    
    high blood pressure or high cholesterol
    diabetes
    depression or anxiety
    hormone problems
    Things you can do to help with erectile dysfunction
    Healthy lifestyle changes can sometimes help with erectile dysfunction.
    
    Do
    lose weight if you're overweight
    
    stop smoking
    
    eat a healthy diet
    
    exercise daily
    
    try to reduce stress and anxiety
    
    Don’t
    do not drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week
    
    do not cycle for a while, if you cycle for more than 3 hours a week
    
    Non-urgent advice:See a GP or go to a sexual health clinic if:
    erection problems keep happening
    It might be a sign of a health condition that can be treated.
    
    Information:
    How sexual health clinics can help with erection problems
    Sexual health clinics treat problems with sexual health. They can provide the same treatment you would get at your GP surgery.
    
    Many sexual health clinics offer a walk-in service, where you do not need an appointment.
    
    They'll often get test results quicker than GP practices.
    
    Find a sexual health clinic near you
    
    What happens at your appointment
    If you see someone about erectile dysfunction, the doctor or nurse may:
    
    ask about your lifestyle and relationships, and any problems you might be having
    do some basic health checks, such as taking your blood pressure
    examine your genitals to rule out any obvious physical cause
    If you have symptoms like needing to pee more often than usual, you may also have an examination of your prostate (rectal examination).
    
    Treatments for erectile dysfunction
    Treatment can usually help improve erectile dysfunction.
    
    Medicines for erectile dysfunction
    The main treatments are medicines that increase the blood flow to your penis, called PDE-5 inhibitors.
    
    These include:
    
    sildenafil (Viagra)
    tadalafil (Cialis)
    vardenafil (Levitra)
    avanafil (Spedra)
    You can get sildenafil on prescription or you can buy it from a pharmacy. You need a prescription for the other types.
    
    Buying Viagra online
    Vacuum pumps
    Vacuum pumps encourage blood to flow to the penis, causing an erection.
    
    They work for most men and can be used if medicine is not suitable or does not work.
    
    They're not always available on the NHS. Speak to a doctor about where to get a vacuum pump.
    
    Treating the cause of erectile dysfunction
    There are also treatments for some of the causes of erectile dysfunction.
    
    For example:
    
    your doctor may switch you to a different medicine if it's causing your erectile dysfunction
    high blood pressure, high cholesterol and hormone problems may be treated with medicine
    counselling and therapy can help if your erection problems are linked to emotional or mental health problems – but there can be a long wait for these services on the NHS

    <div class="term" data-term-id="Back pain" data-term-details="Back pain is one of the most common medical problems in the United States. It can range from a dull, constant ache to a sudden, sharp pain that may shoot down the leg. Sometimes it can come on suddenly – from an accident, a fall, or lifting something heavy, or it can develop slowly because of age-related degenerative changes in the spine. In some cases, inflammatory arthritis disorders or other medical conditions cause back pain.

    Treatment varies depending on the cause and symptoms, and often there are several contributing factors. However, there are steps you can take to improve your health and lower your chance of developing chronic or long-lasting back pain.
    
    Understanding the Anatomy of the Back
    There are many different structures in the anatomy of the back that work together to support your body. Problems with any one of these structures can cause back pain.
    
    There are four regions of the spine:
    Cervical spine.
    Thoracic spine.
    Lumbar spine.
    Sacrum and coccyx.
    Parts of the spine and back include:
    Vertebrae – small bones stacked on top of one another, which protect the spinal cord.
    Spinal cord – long bundle of nerves that run down the back through a canal in the vertebrae.
    Intervertebral discs – cushion-like pads between the vertebrae that act like shock absorbers and spacers for the spine.
    Ligaments – short bands of tough, flexible tissue that hold the vertebrae in place.
    Tendons – cord of tissue that connects muscle to bone.
    Muscles – a bundle of dynamic fibers that support your spine and upper body and help you move.
    Who Gets Back Pain?
    Anyone can have back pain, and almost everyone will experience back pain at some point in their life. Several factors increase your risk of developing back pain and can include:  
    
    Fitness level: Back pain is more common among people who are not physically fit. For example, weak back and stomach muscles may not properly support the spine (core strength). Back pain is also more likely if you exercise too strenuously after being inactive for a while (overdoing it).
    Weight gain: A diet high in calories and fat, combined with an inactive lifestyle, can lead to obesity. This can put stress on the back.
    Job-related risk factors: Jobs that require heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, or twisting can injure the back. A desk job may also play a role, especially if you have poor posture or sit all day in an uncomfortable chair.
    Stress level: If you chronically have poor sleep, depression, or anxiety, back pain can be more frequent and more severe.
    Age: Back pain becomes more common with age, particularly after the age of 45.
    Heredity: Genetics play a role in some disorders that cause back pain.
    Types of Back Pain
    Doctors and researchers describe the types of back pain in the following ways:  
    
    Acute back pain happens suddenly and usually lasts a few days to a few weeks.
    Subacute back pain can come on suddenly or over time and lasts 4 to 12 weeks.
    Chronic back pain may come on quickly or slowly and lasts longer than 12 weeks and occurs daily.
    Symptoms of Back Pain
    Back pain can range from local pain in a specific spot to generalized pain spreading all over the back. Sometimes the pain radiates away from the back to other areas of your body, such as the buttocks, legs, or abdomen. The intensity of back pain varies for each person. Depending on the type, causes, and location of your back pain, you may experience:
    
    Increasing pain with lifting and bending.
    Worsening pain when resting, sitting, or standing.
    Back pain that comes and goes.
    Stiffness in the morning when awakening and lessened back pain with activity.
    Pain that radiates away from the back into the buttocks, leg, or hip.
    Numbness or weakness in your legs or feet.
    You should see a doctor if your pain does not improve after a few weeks or if any of the following symptoms happen with your back pain:
    
    Numbness and tingling.
    Severe back pain that does not improve with medication (see Treatment section).
    Back pain after a fall or injury.
    Back pain along with:
    Trouble urinating.
    Weakness, pain, or numbness in your legs.
    Fever.
    Weight loss that you did not intend.
    Causes of Back Pain
    Back pain can be caused by many different factors, which may all be present at the same time and interact to result in chronic low back pain. These could include mechanical or structural problems with the spine, inflammatory conditions, and other medical conditions. It is also possible that no specific cause can be identified for the start of back pain.
    
    Mechanical/Structural Problems
    Back pain can happen when mechanical or structural problems develop in the spine, discs, muscles, ligaments, or tendons in the back, or compress a nerve.
    
    Sprain: an injury to the ligaments that support thes pine (which connect the different bones together), often occurring from twisting or lifting improperly.
    Strain: an injury to a muscle or tendon.
    Degenerative disc disease: aging causes the discs between the vertebrae of the spine to break down. It is associated with other degenerative changes in the spine, such as arthritis or spinal stenosis.
    Herniated or ruptured discs: an event causing a disc to compress and irritate nearby nerves. This often occurs at the lumbar level but can be present in the cervical spine as well.
    Spondylolisthesis: a vertebra in the spine slips out of place or gradually moves out of alignment.
    Spinal stenosis: a narrowing of the spinal canal that puts pressure on the spinal cord and nerves.
    Fractured vertebrae.
    Scoliosis or other congenital changes to the spine.
    Myofascial pain: tightness and pain of the muscles supporting the spine due to damage to the muscles or a result of the nerve input to the muscles coming from the spine.
    Inflammatory Conditions
    Ankylosing spondylitis, a specific type of arthritis of the spine.
    Other types of inflammatory arthritis of the spine.
    Other Medical Conditions
    Osteoporosis, which can lead to painful fractures of the vertebrae.
    Fibromyalgia, a condition of widespread muscle pain and fatigue.
    Kidney stones or infections.
    Endometriosis, which is the buildup of uterine tissue in places outside the uterus.
    Infections that involve the bones of the spine or the discs between these bones, which can cause back pain.
    Tumors, in rare cases, that develop on the spine or other areas of the back.
    Pregnancy.

    <div class="term" data-term-id="Diabetes" data-term-details="Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how the body uses blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is an important source of energy for the cells that make up the muscles and tissues. It's also the brain's main source of fuel.

    The main cause of diabetes varies by type. But no matter what type of diabetes you have, it can lead to excess sugar in the blood. Too much sugar in the blood can lead to serious health problems.
    
    Chronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Potentially reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes and gestational diabetes. Prediabetes happens when blood sugar levels are higher than normal. But the blood sugar levels aren't high enough to be called diabetes. And prediabetes can lead to diabetes unless steps are taken to prevent it. Gestational diabetes happens during pregnancy. But it may go away after the baby is born.

    Symptoms
    Diabetes symptoms depend on how high your blood sugar is. Some people, especially if they have prediabetes, gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes, may not have symptoms. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe.
    
    Some of the symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are:
    
    Feeling more thirsty than usual.
    Urinating often.
    Losing weight without trying.
    Presence of ketones in the urine. Ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there's not enough available insulin.
    Feeling tired and weak.
    Feeling irritable or having other mood changes.
    Having blurry vision.
    Having slow-healing sores.
    Getting a lot of infections, such as gum, skin and vaginal infections.
    Type 1 diabetes can start at any age. But it often starts during childhood or teen years. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age. Type 2 diabetes is more common in people older than 40. But type 2 diabetes in children is increasing.
    
    When to see a doctor
    If you think you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your health care provider. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin.
    If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize.
    
    Causes
To understand diabetes, it's important to understand how the body normally uses glucose.

How insulin works
Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland behind and below the stomach (pancreas).

The pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream.
The insulin circulates, letting sugar enter the cells.
Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in the bloodstream.
As the blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from the pancreas.
The role of glucose
Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.

Glucose comes from two major sources: food and the liver.
Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.
The liver stores and makes glucose.
When glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose. This keeps your glucose level within a typical range.
The exact cause of most types of diabetes is unknown. In all cases, sugar builds up in the bloodstream. This is because the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of genetic or environmental factors. It is unclear what those factors may be.

Risk factors
Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Family history may play a part in all types. Environmental factors and geography can add to the risk of type 1 diabetes.

Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes immune system cells (autoantibodies). If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes.

Race or ethnicity also may raise your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk.

Prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes are more common in people who are overweight or obese.

Complications
Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. In fact, prediabetes can lead to type 2 diabetes. Possible complications include:

Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. Diabetes majorly increases the risk of many heart problems. These can include coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis). If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke.
Nerve damage from diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). Too much sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish the nerves, especially in the legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward.

Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction.

Kidney damage from diabetes (diabetic nephropathy). The kidneys hold millions of tiny blood vessel clusters (glomeruli) that filter waste from the blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system.
Eye damage from diabetes (diabetic retinopathy). Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the eye. This could lead to blindness.
Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of many foot complications.
Skin and mouth conditions. Diabetes may leave you more prone to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections.
Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes.
Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease.
Depression related to diabetes. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Complications of gestational diabetes
Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby.

Complications in your baby can be caused by gestational diabetes, including:

Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta. Extra glucose triggers the baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large. It can lead to a difficult birth and sometimes the need for a C-section.
Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) shortly after birth. This is because their own insulin production is high.
Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life.
Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can lead to a baby's death either before or shortly after birth.
Complications in the mother also can be caused by gestational diabetes, including:

Preeclampsia. Symptoms of this condition include high blood pressure, too much protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet.
Gestational diabetes. If you had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy.
Prevention
Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. But the healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them:

Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Eat a variety to keep from feeling bored.
Get more physical activity. Try to get about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week. Or aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week. For example, take a brisk daily walk. If you can't fit in a long workout, break it up into smaller sessions throughout the day.
Lose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight can lower the risk of diabetes. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds (90.7 kilograms), losing 14 pounds (6.4 kilograms) can lower the risk of diabetes.

But don't try to lose weight during pregnancy. Talk to your provider about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy.

To keep your weight in a healthy range, work on long-term changes to your eating and exercise habits. Remember the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and higher self-esteem.

Sometimes drugs are an option. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin (Glumetza, Fortamet, others) may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. But healthy lifestyle choices are important. If you have prediabetes, have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to make sure you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.

    <div class="term" data-term-id="Hypertension / pressure" data-term-details="High blood pressure (hypertension) has no symptoms and can be dangerous if not treated. Hypertension puts you at risk for stroke, heart attack and other problems. Nearly half of adults who have hypertension don’t realize it. So, checkups are crucial. Dietary changes, exercise and medicine can help you keep your blood pressure where it should be.
    What is high blood pressure?
High blood pressure is when the force of blood pushing against your artery walls is consistently too high. This damages your arteries over time and can lead to serious complications like heart attack and stroke. “Hypertension” is another word for this common condition.

Healthcare providers call high blood pressure a “silent killer” because you usually don’t have any symptoms. So, you may not be aware that anything is wrong, but the damage is still occurring within your body.

Blood pressure (BP) is the measurement of the pressure or force of blood pushing against blood vessel walls. Your BP reading has two numbers:

The top number is the systolic blood pressure, which measures the pressure on your artery walls when your heart beats or contracts.
The bottom number is the diastolic blood pressure. This measures the pressure on your artery walls between beats when your heart is relaxing.
Healthcare providers measure blood pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).

How do I know if I have high blood pressure?
Getting your blood pressure checked is the only way to know if it’s too high. You can do this by seeing a healthcare provider for a yearly checkup, even if you feel healthy. You won’t feel sick if you have high blood pressure. So, these checkups are crucial and can be life-saving. If your BP is above the normal range, your provider will recommend lifestyle changes and/or medications to lower your numbers.

What is considered high blood pressure?
Definitions of high blood pressure vary slightly depending on where you live. In the U.S., healthcare providers define high blood pressure (hypertension) as:

A top number (systolic blood pressure) of at least 130 mmHg, and/or
A bottom number (diastolic blood pressure) of at least 80 mmHg.
In Europe, healthcare providers define hypertension as:

A top number of at least 140 mmHg, and/or
A bottom number of at least 90 mmHg.
How common is high blood pressure?
High blood pressure is very common. It affects 47% of adults in the U.S. This equals about 116 million people. Of those, 37 million have a blood pressure of at least 140/90 mmHg.

High blood pressure caused or contributed to over 670,000 deaths in the U.S. in 2020.

The World Health Organization estimates that globally, over 1.2 billion people ages 30 to 79 have hypertension. About 2 in 3 of those individuals live in low- or middle-income countries.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the signs and symptoms of high blood pressure?
Usually, high blood pressure causes no signs or symptoms. That’s why healthcare providers call it a “silent killer.” You could have high blood pressure for years and not know it. In fact, the World Health Organization estimates that 46% of adults with hypertension don’t know they have it.

When your blood pressure is 180/120 mmHg or higher, you may experience symptoms like headaches, heart palpitations or nosebleeds. Blood pressure this high is a hypertensive crisis that requires immediate medical care.

What are the types of high blood pressure?
Your provider will diagnose you with one of two types of high blood pressure:

Primary hypertension. Causes of this more common type of high blood pressure (about 90% of all adult cases in the U.S.) include aging and lifestyle factors like not getting enough exercise.
Secondary hypertension. Causes of this type of high blood pressure include different medical conditions or a medication you’re taking.
Primary and secondary high blood pressure (hypertension) can co-exist. For example, a new secondary cause can make blood pressure that’s already high get even higher.

You might also hear about high blood pressure that comes or goes in certain situations. These hypertension types are:

White coat hypertension: Your BP is normal at home but elevated in a healthcare setting.
Masked hypertension: Your BP is normal in a healthcare setting but elevated at home.
Sustained hypertension: Your BP is elevated in healthcare settings and at home.
Nocturnal hypertension: Your BP goes up when you sleep.
What causes hypertension?
Primary hypertension doesn’t have a single, clear cause. Usually, many factors come together to cause it. Common causes include:

Unhealthy eating patterns (including a diet high in sodium).
Lack of physical activity.
High consumption of beverages containing alcohol.
Secondary hypertension has at least one distinct cause that healthcare providers can identify. Common causes of secondary hypertension include:

Certain medications, including immunosuppressants, NSAIDs and oral contraceptives (the pill).
Kidney disease.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
Primary aldosteronism (Conn’s syndrome).
Recreational drug use (including amphetamines and cocaine).
Renal vascular diseases, which are conditions that affect blood flow in your kidneys’ arteries and veins. Renal artery stenosis is a common example.
Tobacco use (including smoking, vaping and using smokeless tobacco).
Is high blood pressure genetic?
Researchers believe genes play a role in high blood pressure. If one or more of your close biological family members have high blood pressure, you have an increased risk of developing it, too.

What are the risk factors for high blood pressure?
Risk factors that make you more likely to have high blood pressure include:

Having biological family members with high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease or diabetes.
Being over age 55.
Being Black.
Having certain medical conditions, including chronic kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea or thyroid disease.
Having overweight or obesity.
Not getting enough exercise.
Eating foods high in sodium.
Smoking or using tobacco products.
Drinking too much.
What are the complications of this condition?
Untreated hypertension may lead to serious health problems including:

Coronary artery disease (CAD).
Stroke.
Heart attack.
Peripheral artery disease.
Kidney disease and kidney failure.
Complications during pregnancy.
Eye damage.
Vascular dementia.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is high blood pressure diagnosed?
Healthcare providers diagnose high blood pressure by measuring it with an arm cuff. Providers usually measure your blood pressure at annual checkups and other appointments.

If you have high blood pressure readings at two or more appointments, your provider may tell you that you have high blood pressure. They’ll talk to you about your medical history and lifestyle to identify possible causes.

Blood pressure categories
In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued new blood pressure guidelines. Healthcare providers in the U.S. use these when diagnosing and treating high blood pressure. The guidelines divide blood pressure readings into four categories, listed in the chart below. You have high blood pressure if you fall into the stage 1 hypertension or stage 2 hypertension categories.


Management and Treatment
What are the treatments for high blood pressure?
High blood pressure treatments include lifestyle changes and medications. Healthcare providers recommend treatment based on your blood pressure readings, the causes of your high blood pressure and your underlying conditions.

Lifestyle changes to lower your blood pressure
You may be wondering if you can lower your blood pressure naturally. Yes, in some cases, it’s possible to lower your blood pressure without medication. For example, your provider may recommend starting with lifestyle changes if you have elevated blood pressure or stage 1 hypertension.

Here are some proven ways to lower your blood pressure naturally:

Keep a weight that’s healthy for you. Your healthcare provider can give you a target range.
Eat a healthy diet. An example is the DASH diet. This is a way of eating that’s full of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy.
Cut down on salt. Ideally, limit your sodium intake to no more than 1,500 milligrams (mg) per day. If this is too difficult at first, you can start by reducing your daily intake by at least 1,000 milligrams.
Get enough potassium. Try to consume 3,500 to 5,000 milligrams per day, ideally through the foods you eat rather than supplements. Some foods high in potassium include bananas, avocados and potatoes (with skin).
Exercise. Ask your healthcare provider for tips to get started. In general, start slow and work your way up to 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week. Resistance training (like lifting light weights) is also helpful.
Limit alcohol. If you choose to drink beverages containing alcohol, do so in moderation.
Sometimes, providers recommend lifestyle changes along with medications to lower your blood pressure.

Medications to lower your blood pressure
Four classes of blood pressure medications are “first-line” (most effective and commonly prescribed) when starting treatment:

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block the production of the angiotensin II hormone, which the body naturally uses to manage blood pressure. When the medicine blocks angiotensin II, your blood vessels don’t narrow.
Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) block this same hormone from binding with receptors in the blood vessels. ARBs work the same way as ACE inhibitors to keep blood vessels from narrowing.
Calcium channel blockersprevent calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels, allowing these vessels to relax.
Diuretics (water or fluid pills) flush excess sodium from your body, reducing the amount of fluid in your blood. People often take diuretics with other high blood pressure medicines, sometimes in one combined pill.
Your provider may couple other medications with these first-line drugs to better manage your blood pressure.

Talk to your provider about possible side effects. If you get side effects that concern you, call your provider. They may change your dose or try a different medication. Don’t stop taking the medicine on your own.

You should avoid some medications during pregnancy. So, be sure to tell your provider if you’re pregnant or could become pregnant.

Prevention
Can I prevent high blood pressure?
Fortunately, there are things you can do to reduce your risk of developing high blood pressure. These include:

Follow a healthy eating plan. This is an important step in keeping your blood pressure normal. The DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) emphasizes adding fruits, vegetables and whole grains to your diet.
Cut down on sodium. To prevent hypertension, you should reduce the amount of sodium in your diet. Try to keep it below 1,500 milligrams a day.
Keep a healthy weight. Going hand-in-hand with a proper diet is keeping a weight that’s healthy for you. Losing excess weight with diet and exercise will help lower your blood pressure to healthier levels.
Keep active. Even simple physical activities, such as walking, can lower your blood pressure (and your weight).
Drink alcohol in moderation. Having more than one drink a day (for women or people assigned female at birth) or more than two drinks a day (for men or people assigned male at birth) can raise blood pressure. One drink is defined as 1 ounce (oz) of alcohol, 5 ounces of wine or 12 ounces of beer.
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have high blood pressure?
Since high blood pressure doesn’t cause symptoms, you probably won’t feel any different with a high blood pressure diagnosis. But it’s important to follow your provider’s instructions to bring your blood pressure down so it doesn’t cause complications later on.

Once high blood pressure leads to complications, you may start to feel symptoms of conditions like coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease. These include:

Stable angina.
Shortness of breath.
Leg pain.
Should I check my blood pressure at home?
Your provider may recommend you check your blood pressure regularly with a home blood pressure monitor. These are automated electronic monitors you can purchase at most pharmacies or online. For some people, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is necessary.

How long does high blood pressure last?
If you have primary high blood pressure, you’ll need to manage it for the rest of your life.

If you have secondary high blood pressure, your blood pressure will most likely come down after you receive treatment for the medical problem that caused it. If a medication caused your high blood pressure, switching to a different medicine may lower your blood pressure.

Living With
When should I see my healthcare provider?
See your provider for yearly checkups. They’ll monitor your blood pressure and recommend treatment, if needed, to help you stay healthy.

When should I go to the ER?
Call 911 or your local emergency number if you have sudden symptoms of a hypertensive crisis. These include:

Shortness of breath.
Headache.
Chest pain.
Blurry vision.
Heart palpitations.
Anxiety.
Dizziness.
Nosebleed.
Vomiting.
What questions should I ask my doctor?
Questions that can help you learn more about your risk for high blood pressure or ways to manage existing high blood pressure include:

What’s my average blood pressure reading?
What’s an ideal blood pressure reading for me?
Should I use a home blood pressure monitor?
What lifestyle changes should I make?
What kinds of exercise should I do?
Do I need medications? If so, which ones and what are the side effects?
Can I keep taking these medications if I get pregnant?
Are there supplements or nonprescription medications I shouldn’t take?
Additional Common Questions
Can supplements or foods lower blood pressure?
Research supports the DASH diet as a way to lower blood pressure naturally. Increasing potassium and reducing sodium through your food choices are specific strategies.

You may read about many other dietary methods for lowering your blood pressure. These methods don’t have the same level or quality of evidence to support their effectiveness. They include:

Probiotics.
Higher intake of protein, flaxseed, fish oil or fiber.
Garlic.
Dark chocolate.
Tea or coffee.
Calcium or magnesium supplements.
Low-carb, vegetarian or Mediterranean diets.
Be a cautious consumer, and talk with your healthcare provider to learn more.

A note from Cleveland Clinic

High blood pressure is a serious but silent condition that can sneak up on you over the years. Seeing a healthcare provider for regular checkups can help you learn your numbers. If you don’t have access to care, learn about available community resources (such as wellness fairs) where blood pressure checks are available. Knowing your blood pressure levels is the first step toward making lifestyle changes that can help keep your arteries healthy.



    
    ">Hypertension / pressure</div>
    <div class="term" data-term-id="Stress" data-term-details="What is stress?
    Stress is our body’s response to pressure. Many different situations or life events can cause stress. It is often triggered when we experience something new or unexpected that threatens our sense of self or when we feel we have little control over a situation.
    
    We all deal with stress differently. Our ability to cope can depend on our genetics, early life events, personality and social and economic circumstances.
    
    When we encounter stress, our body produces stress hormones that trigger a fight or flight response and activate our immune system. This helps us respond quickly to dangerous situations.
    
    Sometimes, this stress response can be helpful. It can help us push through fear or pain so we can run a marathon or deliver a speech, for example. Our stress hormones usually return to normal quickly once the stressful event is over, and there won’t be any lasting effects.
    
    However, too much stress can cause adverse effects. It can leave us in a permanent stage of fight or flight, leaving us overwhelmed or unable to cope. Long term, this can affect our physical and mental health.
    
    What makes us stressed?
    Many things can lead to stress: bereavement, divorce or separation, losing a job or unexpected money problems. Work-related stress can also have a negative impact on your mental health. People affected by work-related stress lose an average of 24 days of work due to ill health.
    
    Even positive life changes, such as moving to a bigger house, gaining a job promotion or going on holiday, can be sources of stress. If you feel stressed in these situations, you may struggle to understand why or be unwilling to share your feelings with others.
    
    What are the signs of stress?
    How you might feel:
    anxious
    afraid
    angry or aggressive
    sad
    irritable
    frustrated
    depressed
    These feelings can sometimes produce physical symptoms, making you feel even worse.
    
    How your body might react:
    headaches
    nausea
    indigestion
    digestive problems such as constipation, bloating or diarrhoea
    shallow breathing or hyperventilating
    sweating
    heart palpitations
    aches and pains
    How you might behave:
    withdraw from other people or snap at them
    be indecisive or inflexible
    be tearful
    have problems getting to sleep or staying asleep
    experience sexual problems
    smoke, drink alcohol or take drugs more than usual
    If the stress is long-lasting, you may notice your sleep and memory are affected, your eating habits change, or you feel less inclined to exercise.
    
    Some research has also linked long-term stress to gastrointestinal conditions like Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) or stomach ulcers and conditions like cardiovascular disease.
    
    Who is affected by stress?
    All of us can probably recognise some of the feelings described above. Some people seem to be more affected by stress than others. For some people, getting out of the door on time each morning can be a very stressful experience, whereas others may be less affected by a great deal of pressure.
    
    Some people are more likely to experience stressful situations than others. For example:
    
    people with a lot of debt or financial insecurity are more likely to be stressed about money
    people from minority ethnic groups or who are LGBTQIA+ are more likely to be stressed about prejudice or discrimination
    people with disabilities or long-term health conditions are more likely to be stressed about their health or the stigma associated with them
    How can you help yourself?
    If you're feeling stressed, there are some things you can try to feel less tense and overwhelmed.
    
    Recognise when stress is a problem
    Connecting the physical and emotional signs you’re experiencing to the pressures you face is important. Don’t ignore physical warning signs such as tense muscles, tiredness, headaches or migraines.
    Think about what’s causing your stress. Sort them into issues with a practical solution, things that will get better with time and things you can't do anything about. Take control by taking small steps towards the things you can improve.
    Make a plan to address the things that you can. This might involve setting yourself realistic expectations and prioritising essential commitments. If you feel overwhelmed, ask for help and say no to things you can’t take on.
     
    Think about where you can make changes
    Are you taking on too much? Could you hand over some things to someone else? Can you do things in a more leisurely way? You may need to prioritise things and reorganise your life, so you’re not trying to do everything at once.
     
    Build supportive relationships
    Find close friends or family who can offer help and practical advice that can support you in managing stress. Joining a club or a course can help to expand your social network and encourage you to do something different. Activities like volunteering can change your perspective and have a beneficial impact on your mood.
     
    Eat healthily
    A healthy diet can improve your mood. Getting enough nutrients (including essential vitamins and minerals) and water can help your mental well-being.
     
    Be aware of your smoking and drinking
    Cut down or cut out smoking and drinking if you can. They may seem to reduce tension but actually make problems worse. Alcohol and caffeine can increase feelings of anxiety.
     
    Get some exercise
    Physical exercise can help manage the effects of stress by producing endorphins that boost your mood. It can be hard to motivate yourself if you're stressed, but even a little bit of activity can make a difference. For example, you could aim to walk for 15-20 minutes three times a week.
     
    Take time out
    Take time to relax and practice self-care, where you do positive things for yourself. Striking a balance between responsibility to others and responsibility to yourself is vital in reducing stress levels.
     
    Be mindful
    Mindfulness meditation can be practised anywhere at any time. Research has suggested it can be helpful for managing and reducing the effect of stress and anxiety.
     
    Get some restful sleep
    If you’re having difficulty sleeping, you can try to reduce the amount of caffeine you consume and avoid too much screen time before bed. Write down a to-do list for the next day to help you prioritise, but make sure you put it aside before bed. Read our guide' How to sleep better' for more tips on getting a good night’s sleep.
     
    Be kind to yourself
    Try to keep things in perspective, and don't be too hard on yourself. Look for positive things in your life, and write down things that make you feel grateful.
    
    ">Stress</div>
    <div class="term" data-term-id="Fever" data-term-details="Fever is the temporary increase in the body's temperature in response to a disease or illness.

    A child has a fever when the temperature is at or above one of these levels:
    
    100.4°F (38°C) measured in the bottom (rectally)
    99.5°F (37.5°C) measured in the mouth (orally)
    99°F (37.2°C) measured under the arm (axillary)
    An adult probably has a fever when the temperature is above 99°F to 99.5°F (37.2°C to 37.5°C), depending on the time of day.
    
    Alternative Names
    Elevated temperature; Hyperthermia; Pyrexia; Febrile
    
    Considerations
    Normal body temperature may change during any given day. It is usually highest in the evening. Other factors that may affect body temperature are:
    
    A woman's menstrual cycle. In the second part of this cycle, her temperature may go up by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more.
    Physical activity, strong emotion, eating, heavy clothing, medicines, high room temperature, and high humidity can all increase body temperature.
    Fever is an important part of the body's defense against infection. Most bacteria and viruses that cause infections in people thrive best at 98.6°F (37°C). Many infants and children develop high fevers with mild viral illnesses. Although a fever signals that a battle might be going on in the body, the fever is fighting for, not against the person.
    
    Brain damage from a fever generally will not occur unless the fever is over 107.6°F (42°C). Untreated fevers caused by infection will seldom go over 105°F (40.6°C) unless the child is overdressed or in a hot place.
    
    Febrile seizures do occur in some children. Most febrile seizures are over quickly and do not mean your child has epilepsy. These seizures also do not cause any permanent harm.
    
    Unexplained fevers that continue for days or weeks are called fevers of undetermined origin (FUO).
    
    Causes
    Almost any infection can cause a fever, including:
    
    Bone infections (osteomyelitis), appendicitis, skin infections or cellulitis, and meningitis
    Respiratory infections such as colds or flu-like illnesses, sore throats, ear infections, sinus infections, mononucleosis, bronchitis, pneumonia, and tuberculosis
    Urinary tract infections
    Viral gastroenteritis and bacterial gastroenteritis
    Children and adults may have a low-grade fever for 1 or 2 days after some immunizations.
    
    Teething may cause a slight increase in a child's temperature, but not higher than 100°F (37.8°C).
    
    Autoimmune or inflammatory disorders may also cause fevers. Some examples are:
    
    Arthritis or connective tissue illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus
    Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease
    Vasculitis or periarteritis nodosa
    The first symptom of a cancer may be a fever. This is particularly true of Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia.
    
    Other possible causes of fever include:
    
    Blood clots or thrombophlebitis
    Medicines, such as some antibiotics, antihistamines, and seizure medicines
    Home Care
    A simple cold or other viral infection can sometimes cause a high fever (102°F to 104°F or 38.9°C to 40°C). This does not mean you or your child has a serious problem. Some serious infections don't cause a fever or can cause a very low body temperature, most often in infants.
    
    If the fever is mild and you have no other problems, you do not need treatment. Drink fluids and rest.
    
    The illness is probably not serious if your child:
    
    Is still interested in playing
    Is eating and drinking well
    Is alert and smiling at you
    Has a normal skin color
    Looks well when their temperature comes down
    Take steps to lower a fever if you or your child is uncomfortable, vomiting, dried out (dehydrated), or not sleeping well. Remember, the goal is to lower, not eliminate, the fever.
    
    When trying to lower a fever:
    
    Do not bundle up someone who has chills.
    Remove excess clothing or blankets. The room should be comfortable, not too hot or cool. Try one layer of lightweight clothing, and one lightweight blanket for sleep. If the room is hot or stuffy, a fan may help.
    A lukewarm bath or sponge bath may help cool someone with a fever. This is effective after medicine is given -- otherwise the temperature might bounce right back up.
    Do not use cold baths, ice, or alcohol rubs. These cool the skin, but often make the situation worse by causing shivering, which raises the core body temperature.
    Here are some guidelines for taking medicine to lower a fever:
    
    Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help reduce fever in children and adults. Sometimes health care providers advise you to use both types of medicine.
    Take acetaminophen every 4 to 6 hours. It works by turning down the brain's thermostat.
    Take ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours. Do not use ibuprofen in children 6 months or younger.
    Aspirin is very effective for treating fever in adults. Do not give aspirin to a child unless your child's provider tells you to.
    Know how much you or your child weighs. Then check the instructions on the package to find the correct dose.
    In children 3 months or younger, call your child's provider first before giving medicines.
    Eating and drinking:
    
    Everyone, particularly children, should drink plenty of fluids. Water, ice pops, soup, and gelatin are all good choices.
    In younger children do not give too much fruit juice or apple juice, and do not give sports drinks.
    Although eating is fine, do not force foods.
    When to Contact a Medical Professional
    Contact a provider right away if your child:
    
    Is 3 months or younger and has a rectal temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher

    Is 2 years or younger and has a fever that lasts longer than 24 to 48 hours
    Is older and has a fever for longer than 48 to 72 hours
    Has a fever of 105°F (40.5°C) or higher, unless it comes down readily with treatment and the person is comfortable
    Has other symptoms that suggest an illness may need to be treated, such as a sore throat, earache, or cough
    Has had fevers come and go for up to a week or more, even if these fevers are not very high

    ">Fever</div>
    <div class="term" data-term-id="HIV" data-term-details="Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). When a person becomes infected with HIV, the virus attacks and weakens the immune system. As the immune system weakens, the person is at risk for getting life-threatening infections and cancers. When that happens, the illness is called AIDS. Once a person has the virus, it stays inside the body for life.

    Alternative Names
    HIV infection; Infection - HIV; Human immunodeficiency virus; Acquired immune deficiency syndrome: HIV-1
    
    Causes
    The virus is spread (transmitted) person-to-person through certain body fluids:
    
    Blood
    Semen and preseminal fluid
    Rectal fluids
    Vaginal fluids
    Breast milk
    HIV can be spread if these fluids come in contact with:
    
    Mucous membranes (inside of the mouth, penis, vagina, rectum)
    Damaged tissue (tissue that has been cut or scraped)
    The blood stream by injection
    HIV cannot be spread through sweat, saliva, or urine.
    
    In the United States, HIV is mainly spread:
    
    Through vaginal or anal sex without using a condom with someone who has HIV who is not taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV
    Through needle sharing or other equipment used to inject drugs with someone who has HIV
    Less often, HIV is spread:
    
    From mother to child. A pregnant woman can spread the virus to her fetus through their shared blood circulation, or a nursing mother can pass it to her baby through her breast milk. Testing and treatment of HIV-positive mothers has helped lower the number of babies getting HIV.
    Through needle sticks or other sharp objects that are contaminated with HIV (mainly health care workers).
    Primary HIV infection
    The virus is NOT spread by:
    
    Casual contact, such as hugging or closed-mouth kissing
    Mosquitoes or pets
    Participating in sports
    Touching items that were touched by a person infected with the virus
    Eating food handled by a person with HIV
    Intimate contact with an HIV-positive person with a stably undetectable viral load
    HIV and blood or organ donation:
    
    HIV is not spread to a person who donates blood or organs. People who donate organs are never in direct contact with the people who receive them. Likewise, a person who donates blood is never in contact with the person receiving it. In all of these procedures, sterile needles and instruments are used.
    Blood banks and organ donor programs thoroughly check (screen) donors, blood, and tissues. It is very unlikely to get HIV from blood transfusions, blood products, or organ or tissue transplants.
    Risk factors for getting HIV include:
    
    Having unprotected anal or vaginal sex. Receptive anal sex is the riskiest. Having multiple partners also increases the risk. Using a new condom correctly every time you have sex greatly helps lower this risk.
    Using drugs and sharing needles or syringes.
    Having a sexual partner with HIV who is not taking HIV medicines or who has a detectable viral load.
    Having a sexually-transmitted disease (STD).
    Symptoms
    Symptoms related to acute HIV infection (when a person is first infected) can be similar to the flu or other viral illnesses. They include:
    
    Fever and muscle pains
    Headache
    Sore throat
    Night sweats
    Mouth sores, including yeast infection (thrush)
    Swollen lymph glands
    Diarrhea
    Many people have no symptoms when they are first infected with HIV.
    
    Acute HIV infection (Stage 1) progresses over a few weeks to months to become chronic or asymptomatic HIV infection (Stage 2) (no symptoms). This stage can last 10 years or longer. During this period, the person might have no reason to suspect they have HIV, but they can spread the virus to others.
    
    If they are not treated, almost all people infected with HIV will develop AIDS (Stage 3). Some people develop AIDS within a few years of infection. Others remain completely healthy after 10 or even 20 years (called long-term nonprogressors).
    
    People with AIDS have had their immune system damaged by HIV. They are at very high risk of getting infections that are uncommon in people with a healthy immune system. These infections are called opportunistic infections and can affect any part of the body. These can be caused by:
    
    Bacteria
    Viruses
    Fungi
    Protozoa
    People with AIDS are also at higher risk for certain cancers, especially lymphomas and a skin cancer called Kaposi sarcoma.
    
    Symptoms depend on the particular infection and which part of the body is infected.
    
    Lung infections are common in AIDS and often cause cough, fever, and shortness of breath.
    
    Intestinal infections are also common and can cause:
    
    Diarrhea
    Abdominal pain
    Vomiting
    Swallowing problems
    Other common symptoms in people with HIV infection and AIDS include:
    
    Weight loss
    Fever
    Sweats
    Rashes
    Swollen lymph glands
    Exams and Tests
    There are tests that are done to check if you've been infected with HIV.
    
    DIAGNOSTIC TESTS
    
    In general, testing is a 2-step process:
    
    Screening test -- There are several kinds of tests. Some are blood tests, others are mouth fluid tests. They check for antibodies to the HIV virus, HIV antigen, or both. Some screening tests can give results in 30 minutes or less.
    Follow-up test -- This is also called a confirmatory test. It is often done when the screening test is positive.
    Home tests are available to test for HIV. If you plan to use one, check to make sure it is approved by the FDA. Follow instructions on the packaging to ensure the results are as accurate as possible.
    
    The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone ages 15 to 65 have a screening test for HIV. People with risky behaviors should be tested regularly. Pregnant women should also have a screening test.
    
    TESTS AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED WITH HIV
    
    People with AIDS should have regular blood tests to check their CD4 cell count:
    
    CD4 T cells are the blood cells that HIV attacks. They are also called T4 cells or helper T cells.
    As HIV damages the immune system, the CD4 count drops. A normal CD4 count is from 500 to 1,500 cells/mm3 of blood.
    People usually develop symptoms when their CD4 count drops below 350. More serious complications occur when the CD4 count drops to 200. When the count is below 200, the person is said to have AIDS.
    Other tests include:
    
    HIV RNA level, or viral load, to check how much HIV is in the blood
    A resistance test to see if the virus has any changes in the genetic code that would lead to resistance to the medicines used to treat HIV
    Complete blood count, blood chemistry, and urine test
    Tests for other sexually transmitted infections
    TB test
    Pap test to check for cervical cancer
    Anal Pap test to check for cancer of the anus
    Treatment
    HIV/AIDS is treated with medicines that stop the virus from multiplying. This treatment is called antiretroviral therapy (ART).
    
    In the past, people with HIV infection would start antiretroviral treatment after their CD4 count dropped or they developed HIV complications. Today, HIV treatment is recommended for all people with HIV infection, even if their CD4 count is still normal.
    
    There are two types or treatment:
    
    Pills are given to people who are just starting treatment.
    Shots may be given to people who have an undetectable viral load or who have been virally suppressed for at least 3 months. Shots may be given every month or every other month.
    Regular blood tests are needed to make sure the virus level in the blood (viral load) is kept low or suppressed. The goal of treatment is to lower the HIV virus in the blood to a level that is so low that the test can't detect it. This is called an undetectable viral load.
    
    If the CD4 count already dropped before treatment was started, it will usually slowly go up. HIV complications often disappear as the immune system recovers.
    
    Support Groups
    Joining a support group where members share common experiences and problems can often help lower the emotional stress of having a long-term illness.
    
    Outlook (Prognosis)
    With treatment, most people with HIV/AIDS can live a healthy and normal life.
    
    Current treatments do not cure the infection. The medicines only work as long as they are taken every day. If the medicines are stopped, the viral load will go up and the CD4 count will drop. If the medicines are not taken regularly, the virus can become resistant to one or more of the medicines, and the treatment will stop working.
    
    People who are on treatment need to see their health care providers regularly. This is to make sure the medicines are working and to check for side effects of the medicines.
    
    When to Contact a Medical Professional
    Contact your provider for an appointment if you have any risk factors for HIV infection. Also contact your provider if you develop symptoms of AIDS. By law, the results of HIV testing must be kept confidential (private). Your provider will review your test results with you.
    
    Prevention
    Preventing HIV/AIDS:
    
    Get tested. People who don't know they have HIV infection and who look and feel healthy are the most likely to transmit it to others.
    Do not use illegal drugs and do not share needles or syringes. Many communities have needle exchange programs where you can get rid of used syringes and get new, sterile ones. Staff at these programs can also refer you for addiction treatment.
    Avoid contact with another person's blood. If possible, wear protective clothing, a mask, and goggles when caring for people who are injured.
    If you test positive for HIV, you can pass the virus to others. You should not donate blood, plasma, body organs, or sperm.
    HIV-positive women who might become pregnant should talk to their provider about the risk to their unborn child. They should also discuss methods to prevent their baby from becoming infected, such as taking antiretroviral medicines during pregnancy.
    Breastfeeding should be avoided to prevent passing HIV to infants through breast milk.
    Safer sex practices, such as using latex condoms, are effective in preventing the spread of HIV. But there is still a risk of getting the infection, even with the use of condoms (for example, condoms can tear).
    
    In people who aren't infected with the virus, but are at high risk of getting it, certain medicines can help prevent infection.
    
    Truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) - taken as a pill
    Descovy (emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide) - taken as a pill
    Apretude (cabotegravir) - given as a shot every other month to help prevent infection
    This treatment is known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. Talk to your provider if you think PrEP might be right for you.
    
    HIV-positive people who are taking antiretroviral medicines and have no detectible virus in their blood do not transmit the virus.
    
    The US blood supply is among the safest in the world. Nearly all people infected with HIV through blood transfusions received those transfusions before 1985, the year HIV testing began for all donated blood.
    
    If you believe you have been exposed to HIV, seek medical attention right away. Do not delay. Starting antiviral medicines right after the exposure (up to 3 days after) can reduce the chance that you will be infected. This is called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). It has been used to prevent transmission in health care workers injured by needlesticks.

    <div class="term" data-term-id="Urinary tract infection" data-term-details="A urinary tract infection is a very common type of infection in your urinary system. It can involve any part of your urinary system. Bacteria — especially E. coli — are the most common cause of UTIs. Symptoms include needing to pee often, pain while peeing and pain in your side or lower back. Antibiotics can treat most UTIs.

    What is a urinary tract infection (UTI)?
UTIs are common infections that happen when bacteria, often from the skin or rectum, enter the urethra, and infect the urinary tract. The infections can affect several parts of the urinary tract, but the most common type is a bladder infection (cystitis).

Kidney infection (pyelonephritis) is another type of UTI. They’re less common, but more serious than bladder infections.

Risk Factors
Some people are at higher risk of getting a UTI. UTIs are more common in females because their urethras are shorter and closer to the rectum. This makes it easier for bacteria to enter the urinary tract.

Other factors that can increase the risk of UTIs:

A previous UTI
Sexual activity
Changes in the bacteria that live inside the vagina, or vaginal flora. For example, menopause or the use of spermicides can cause these bacterial changes.
Pregnancy
Age (older adults and young children are more likely to get UTIs)
Structural problems in the urinary tract, such as enlarged prostate
Poor hygiene, for example, in children who are potty-training
Symptoms
Symptoms of a bladder infection can include:

Pain or burning while urinating
Frequent urination
Feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder
Bloody urine
Pressure or cramping in the groin or lower abdomen
Symptoms of a kidney infection can include:

Fever
Chills
Lower back pain or pain in the side of your back
Nausea or vomiting
Younger children may not be able to tell you about UTI symptoms they are having. While fever is the most common sign of UTI in infants and toddlers, most children with fever do not have a UTI. If you have concerns that your child may have a UTI, talk to a healthcare professional.

When to Seek Medical Care
Talk to your healthcare professional if you have symptoms of a UTI or for any symptom that is severe or concerning.

Taking antibiotics, prescribed by a healthcare professional, at home can treat most UTIs. However, some cases may require treatment in a hospital.

Treatment
Your healthcare professional will determine if you have a UTI by:

Asking about symptoms
Doing a physical exam
Ordering urine tests, if needed
Bacteria cause UTIs and antibiotics treat them. However, any time you take antibiotics, they can cause side effects. Side effects can include rash, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, and yeast infections. More serious side effects can include antibiotic-resistant infections or C. diff infection, which causes diarrhea that can lead to severe colon damage and death. Call your healthcare professional if you develop any side effects while taking your antibiotic.

Sometimes other illnesses, such as sexually transmitted diseases, have symptoms similar to UTIs. Your healthcare professional can determine if a UTI or different illness is causing your symptoms and determine the best treatment.

How to Feel Better
If your healthcare professional prescribes you antibiotics:

Take antibiotics exactly as your healthcare professional tells you.
Do not share your antibiotics with others.
Do not save antibiotics for later. Talk to your healthcare professional about safely discarding leftover antibiotics.
Drink plenty of water or other fluids. Your healthcare professional might also recommend medicine to help lessen the pain or discomfort. Talk with your healthcare professional if you have any questions about your antibiotics.

Prevention
You can help prevent UTIs by doing the following:

Urinate after sexual activity.
Stay well hydrated.
Take showers instead of baths.
Minimize douching, sprays, or powders in the genital area.
Teach girls when potty training to wipe front to back.

Some species of Candida can cause infection in people; the most common is Candida albicans. Candida normally lives on skin and inside the body, such as the mouth, throat, gut, and vagina, without causing problems. Candida can cause infections if it grows out of control or if it enters deep into the body.

    <div class="term" data-term-id="Masturbation" data-term-details="Masturbation is when an individual stimulates their genitals for sexual pleasure, which may or may not lead to orgasm. There are many myths regarding the side effects of masturbation, but the majority of these are false.
    Masturbation is common among men and women of all ages and plays a roleTrusted Source in healthy sexual development.

    Research has foundTrusted Source that among adolescents aged 14–17 years in the United States, around 74 percent of males and 48 percent of females masturbate.
    
    Among older adults, roughly 63 percentTrusted Source of men and 32 percent of women between 57 and 64 years of age masturbate.
    
    People masturbate for many reasons. These include pleasure, enjoyment, fun, and tension release. Some individuals masturbate alone, while others masturbate with a partner.
    
    This article looks at the potential side effects of masturbation and sorts the facts from the fiction regarding masturbation myths. It also identifies some of the health benefits of masturbatio

    Masturbation myths
There are many myths about masturbation. Even though many of these have been debunked several times, they seem to resurface time and time again.

Most claims about masturbation are not backed up by science. There is often no scientific evidence to show that masturbation causes any of the adverse effects suggested. Masturbation will not cause:

blindness
hairy palms
impotence later in life
erectile dysfunction
penis shrinkage
penis curvature
low sperm count
infertility
mental illness
physical weakness
Some couples worry that their relationship must be unsatisfying if either one of them masturbates; this, too, is a myth.

Most men and women continue to masturbate either alone or together when they are in a relationship or married, and many find it an enjoyable part of their relationship.

One study found that women who masturbated had happier marriages compared to those who did not masturbate.

Masturbation side effects
Masturbation is harmless. Some people may experience chafing or tender skin if they are too rough, but this will usually heal in a few days.

If men frequently masturbate within a short space of time, they may experience a slight swelling of the penis called an edema. This swelling usually disappears within a couple of days.

Other potential side effects include:

Guilt
Some people who worry that masturbation conflicts with their religious, spiritual, or cultural beliefs may experience feelings of guilt. However, masturbation is not immoral or wrong, and self-pleasure is not shameful.

Discussing feelings of guilt with a friend, healthcare professional, or therapist that specializes in sexual health might help a person to move past feelings of guilt or shame that they connect with masturbation.

Decreased sexual sensitivity

f men have an aggressive masturbation method that involves too tight a grip on their penis, they can experience decreased sensation. A man can resolve this over time with a change of technique.

Enhanced stimulation, such as using a vibrator, may increase arousal and overall sexual function in both men and women.

Women who use a vibrator have reported improved sexual function and lubrication, while men experienced an improvement in erectile function.

Prostate cancer
The jury is out as to whether masturbation increases or decreases the risk of prostate cancer. Researchers need to conduct more studies before they can reach a conclusion.

A 2003 studyTrusted Source demonstrated that men who ejaculated more than five times each week during their 20s were one third less likely to develop aggressive prostate cancer than those who ejaculated less often.

Researchers speculate that the reduced risk was because frequent ejaculation may prevent the build-up of cancer-causing agents in the prostate gland.

A similar link between frequent ejaculation and a lower risk of prostate cancer was discovered in a 2016 studyTrusted Source. Researchers found that men who ejaculated 21 times per month or more had a reduced risk of developing prostate cancer.

In contrast, a 2008 studyTrusted Source found that frequent sexual activity during a man’s 20s and 30s increased his risk of prostate cancer, especially if he masturbated regularly.

Disrupting daily life
In rare cases, some individuals may masturbate more than they desire, which may:

cause them to miss work, school, or important social events
interrupt a person’s daily functioning
affect their responsibilities and relationships
serve as an escape from relationship issues or substitute for real-life experiences
Someone who thinks they might be adversely impacted by their masturbation practice should speak with a healthcare professional.

    <div class="term" data-term-id="Diarrhea" data-term-details="Alternative Names
    Stools - watery; Frequent bowel movements; Loose bowel movements; Unformed bowel movements
    
    Considerations
    In some people, diarrhea is mild and goes away in a few days. In other people, it may last longer.
    
    Diarrhea can make you feel weak and dehydrated.
    
    Diarrhea in babies and children can be serious. It needs to be treated differently than you would treat diarrhea in adults.
    
    Talk with your health care provider if your child has diarrhea. There can be a lot to know. Your provider can help you learn how to recognize and treat diarrhea in babies and in children.
    
    Causes
    The most common cause of diarrhea is the stomach flu (viral gastroenteritis). This mild viral infection most often goes away on its own within a few days.
    
    Eating or drinking food or water that contains certain types of bacteria or parasites can also lead to diarrhea. This problem may be called food poisoning.
    
    Certain medicines may also cause diarrhea, including:
    
    Some antibiotics
    Chemotherapy drugs for cancer
    Laxatives containing magnesium
    Diarrhea may also be caused by medical disorders, such as:
    
    Celiac disease
    Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis)
    Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
    Lactose intolerance (which causes problems after drinking milk and eating other dairy products)
    Malabsorption syndromes
    Less common causes of diarrhea include:
    
    Carcinoid syndrome
    Disorders of the nerves that supply the intestines
    Removal of part of the stomach (gastrectomy) or small intestine
    Radiation therapy
    People who travel to developing countries can get diarrhea from unclean water or food that has not been handled safely. Plan ahead by learning the risks and treatment for traveler's diarrhea before your trip.
    
    Home Care
    Most times, you can treat diarrhea at home. You will need to learn:
    
    To drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration (when your body does not have the proper amount of water and fluids)
    Which foods you should or should not eat
    What to do if you are breastfeeding
    What danger signs to watch for
    Avoid medicines for diarrhea that you can buy without a prescription unless your provider tells you to use them. These drugs can make some infections worse.
    
    If you have a long-term form of diarrhea, such as diarrhea caused by irritable bowel syndrome, changes to your diet and lifestyle may help.
    
    When to Contact a Medical Professional
    Contact your provider right away if you or your child shows signs of dehydration:
    
    Decreased urine (fewer wet diapers in infants)
    Dizziness or lightheadedness
    Dry mouth
    Sunken eyes
    Few tears when crying
    Schedule an appointment with your provider if you have:
    
    Blood or pus in your stools
    Black stools
    Stomach pain that does not go away after a bowel movement
    Diarrhea with a fever above 101°F or 38.33°C (100.4°F or 38°C in children)
    Recently traveled to a foreign country and developed diarrhea
    Also contact your provider if:
    
    The diarrhea gets worse or does not get better in 2 days for an infant or child, or 5 days for adults
    A child over 3 months old has been vomiting for more than 12 hours; in younger babies, call as soon as vomiting or diarrhea begins
    What to Expect at Your Office Visit
    Your provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history and symptoms.
    
    Lab tests may be done on your stools to find the cause of your diarrhea.
    
    This is also a good time to ask your provider any questions you have about diarrhea.
    
    Over-the-counter supplements that contain healthy bacteria may help prevent diarrhea caused by taking antibiotics. These are called probiotics. Yogurt with active or live cultures is also a good source of these healthy bacteria.
    
    The following healthy steps can help you prevent illnesses that cause diarrhea:
    
    Wash your hands often, particularly after using the toilet and before eating.
    Use alcohol-based hand gel frequently.
    Teach children to not put objects in their mouth.
    Take steps to avoid food poisoning.
    When traveling to underdeveloped areas, follow the steps below to avoid diarrhea:
    
    Drink only bottled water and DO NOT use ice, unless it is made from bottled or purified water.
    DO NOT eat uncooked vegetables or fruits that do not have peels.
    DO NOT eat raw shellfish or undercooked meat.
    DO NOT consume dairy products.
    
    
    ">Diarrhea</div>
    <div class="term" data-term-id="Cervical Cancer" data-term-details="Cervical cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina.

    Various strains of the human papillomavirus, also called HPV, play a role in causing most cervical cancers. HPV is a common infection that's passed through sexual contact. When exposed to HPV, the body's immune system typically prevents the virus from doing harm. In a small percentage of people, however, the virus survives for years. This contributes to the process that causes some cervical cells to become cancer cells.
    
    You can reduce your risk of developing cervical cancer by having screening tests and receiving a vaccine that protects against HPV infection.
    
    When cervical cancer happens, it's often first treated with surgery to remove the cancer. Other treatments may include medicines to kill the cancer cells. Options might include chemotherapy and targeted therapy medicines. Radiation therapy with powerful energy beams also may be used. Sometimes treatment combines radiation with low-dose chemotherapy.
    
    When it starts, cervical cancer might not cause symptoms. As it grows, cervical cancer might cause signs and symptoms, such as:

Vaginal bleeding after intercourse, between periods or after menopause.
Menstrual bleeding that is heavier and lasts longer than usual.
Watery, bloody vaginal discharge that may be heavy and have a foul odor.
Pelvic pain or pain during intercourse.

                Hello,


It appears that he has an infection causing diarrhea. In such a case, I suggest you give him the tablet Ofloxacin 200 mg + Ornidazole (twice daily) for five days after a meal, and the tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg + Domperidone 10 mg (twice daily) for five days before a meal. If he experiences a fever, I suggest him to take a tablet of Paracetamol 500 mg (twice daily) for two days after a meal, in addition to the above medications. Remember to stay hydrated by consuming plenty of liquids, including water and fresh lime juice. He should start feeling better within one to two days after beginning the medication. Please give these tablets only if he is not allergic to them. If you notice any adverse reactions, please seek immediate follow-up.

This professional advice provided by me stands subject to the actual examination of the report or image and is based entirely on inputs provided to me. It should be correlated with clinical findings.

            I am having some queries on HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). I had protected sex with a call girl four weeks back and do not know about her HIV status. 
            I heard from her, she lost weight in recent months and also has cough. After two weeks, I got diarrhea, itching and feverish feeling. I then consulted a 
            doctor and he said it is food poisoning. I checked HIV through P24 combo test and the result was negative. Again, on the 23rd day, I checked through Rapid 
            test and result is negative. From the last four days, I am having itching, twice bowel movement, and headache from yesterday. Again, the doctor told it is 
            food poisoning. I am worrying, is this sign of HIV? When do I need to be tested again? What are the symptoms?

        <br>

                Doctors Response:
            </strong>
            All girls are high-risk group for HIV infection. Your complaint of diarrhea and fever may be due to anxiety causing increased bowel movements and increased core temperature causing fever. Rapid tests will be negative for 45 to 90 days. It is too early to have diarrhea and fever from HIV infection. Get tested for HIV tests after 45 days.

            </strong>
            I read your query and understand your concern.

            Vomiting and diarrhea can lead to dehydration, causing painful urination. Keep him hydrated (at least eight cups daily). If the pain persists, consider a urinary tract infection. Confirm with a urine analysis and treat with antibiotics. For vomiting, I suggest using Metoclopramide (Metoclopramide hydrochloride monohydrate 5 mg), and for diarrhea, I suggest capsule Imodium (Loperamide 2 mg). Consult your doctor and take the medicines.
            
            I hope this helps. And please remember to visit our sanyu hospital for further examination and guidance</p>

            I missed my period for 12 days, and I did a pregnancy test after four days of my period, and it was negative. What is the reason? Is there a risk of pregnancy?

            Thanks.
<br>

                I understand your concern.

                Since your urine pregnancy test is negative, there is nothing to worry about. The delay could be because of hormonal changes due to stress and strain, anxiety, work pressure, change of place, change in climate, or low blood count. However, if you have a doubt, then get a blood test for pregnancy done to ensure that you are not pregnant. Do get back to me with reports so that I can guide you further.
                
                I hope this information will help you.
                
                Thank you.

                A pregnant woman usually has edema (swollen lower extremities) especially if she has been standing quite long. However, it is never tender but just heavy. It spontaneously resolves when she places her feet at least two pillows higher than her body or only by little elevation. In your case, we must rule out the possibility of cellulitis. Its is a condition such as how you described, swollen feet or ankle, usually pinkish or erythematous and tender to touch, sometimes warm to touch. Your symptoms are not the usual finding on a pregnant woman and must be seen immediately at the emergency room to give you first aid of a possibility of infection. It is also best that you have your blood pressure taken since the pregnant patient with edema usually has elevated blood pressure. And i hope you have already begun your antenatal visits. if not please make sure to begin attending antenatal as soon as possible. you can also visit Sanyu hospital and begin your routine antenatal visits and examination as you prepare to receive your precious baby.

                        <strong>Hello doctor,</strong>
            

                        I and my 19-year-old girlfriend had sex with no penetration but rub, four to five days before her ovulation day. She always has regular periods, but this time she had periods for just two days and had very less blood. There were a normal amount of blood clots and the color was also regular, it is just the blood that was less. She also had mild cramps which were bearable, usually, she does get strong cramps. After this two-day period, she said she has been having pain in her legs. She recently started swimming too, three days prior to her periods, and during her periods she discontinued. We did not have sex and she's a virgin. She also said that she is gaining some fat around her breast and body in general. What are the chances of her getting pregnant?            <br>
            <br>

                            I read your query and understand your concern. The occurrence of your periods is a clear indication that the pregnancy is not there and there is no possibility of getting pregnant. As far as the duration of the period is concerned as she was having normal bleeding but it lasted only for two days still it would be considered your normal period and there is no need to do any tests or to worry about the pregnancy. The leg cramps that she is experiencing after the periods are basically due to weakness or it may be due to anemia which is also causing the decreased duration of the periods I would suggest she take more dairy products like yogurt, and milk and get some exercise like raising the legs 10 times or she can have a walk daily for at least 30 minutes. She should also include in a diet green leafy vegetables along with some fruits like apples. The cause of decreased duration of the period may be due to hormonal imbalance, anemia, or thyroid dysfunction. Please get a complete blood count and thyroid profile done and review the reports. I hope I have cleared all your doubts. please you can as well visit us at Sanyu hospital and have further tests and examination

                        I am 38 weeks pregnant and I have been suffering from swelling in my feet for the past week. I have tried all ways to reduce the swelling but nothing is working, and it is now becoming painful. Please help.         <br>   <br>

                            I read your query and can understand your concern.

                            I am sorry to hear that you are experiencing swelling in your feet during your pregnancy. Swelling in the feet is a common symptom during pregnancy due to the increased pressure on the blood vessels in the lower part of the body. You should ask your doctor to measure your blood pressure.
                            
                            Here are some tips that may help reduce the swelling in your feet:
                            
                            1. Elevate your feet: Lie down on your left side and elevate your feet above your heart for 20 to 30 minutes at a time, several times a day.
                            
                            2. Wear comfortable shoes: Avoid tight-fitting shoes and wear comfortable shoes with good arch support.
                            
                            3. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to help flush out excess fluid from your body.
                            
                            4. Avoid standing or sitting for long periods of time: Take breaks to move around and stretch your legs and feet.
                            
                            5. Wear compression stockings: Consider wearing compression stockings, which can help improve circulation in your legs and reduce swelling. and hope you have been attending your antenatal visits frequently and you are prepared to give birth. you can visit us at Sanyu hospital for all your maternal and child health care. Thanks.
